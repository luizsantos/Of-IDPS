* Of-IDPS instalation:

  We have two ways to install and execute Of-IDPS: (i) using a Of-IDPS virtual machine - VM; or (ii) installing source code in your system:

  i. The easy way, download the Of-IDPS VM:

    1. Make Of-IDPS VM download on:
     
      - https://mega.co.nz/#!csZFGKTZ!TZBCROjFBFPJi6D0P0Y6K4VQoDsKKDUeL84i9QU81Uw
    
    2. Execute this VM.

    3. The user named "of" will enter automaticaly on the grafic interface, if necessary all passwords are "ofidps" including the "root" password. 
    The postgres user in the postgres database on the VM also is "ofidps".

    
  ii. To install Of-IDPS in your own system:

    1. Install Beacon OpenFlow controller using the following tutorial https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/Beacon/Quick+Start

    2. Inside of Beacon directory, make:

      2.1. Remove the content of net.beaconcontroller.tutorial directory, for example:

	$ rm -rf <of-idps home directory>/net.beaconcontroller.tutorial

      2.2. Put the content from this gitgub project on the net.beaconcontroller.tutorial directory. For that, you can use the follow commands:

	$ cd <of-idps home directory>
	
	$ git clone https://github.com/luizsantos/Of-IDPS
	
	$ ln -s <of-idps home directory>/Of-IDPS <of-idps home directory>/net.beaconcontroller.tutorial
	
      2.3. Install and configure postgres database:
      
	2.3.1. Install Postgres database (http://www.postgresql.org/);
	
	2.3.2. Create database:
	  $ sh <of-idps home directory>/net.beaconcontroller.tutorial/scripts/DatabaseScripts/createDB_POSTGRES.sh
	  $ sh <of-idps home directory>/net.beaconcontroller.tutorial/scripts/DatabaseScripts/createTables_POSTGRES.sh

      2.4. Execute the Of-IDPS with the name of net.beaconcontroller.tutorial in the Eclipse project. 
      For help, you can read the https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/Beacon/Quick+Start 
      or follow the steps on the executionStepsForAutomaticTestsWithOf-IDPS.pdf tutorial. 
      More configurations can be necessary in accordance with your network environment.

      2.5. Set up your OpenFlow switches to use the Of-IDPS OpenFlow controller IP address.

      
* To execute the Of-IDPS in a simulated environment and make tests, you can:

  i. The easy way, download and execute the altered Mininet VM to Of-IDPS tests:

    - https://mega.co.nz/#!E0o01DhZ!I0eIZnJLXpHajhBP6Ss8ZA54o6zWNtXuwUT38hTZ3LI


  ii. Install the official Mininet network simulator using the http://mininet.org/download/ tutorial.

  After that you have instaled the Mininet, you can alter this instalation to execute our custom tests. To this execute the steps:
    
    1. Inside of mininet user home directory:

      1.1 Clone the Of-IDPS gitgub project:

	$ git clone https://github.com/luizsantos/Of-IDPS
	
      1.2 Copy the scripts to execute custom tests to mininet home:
      
	$ cp -R <ofidps github directory>/shHosts /home/mininet
	$ cp -R <ofidps github directory>/shIDS /home/mininet
	$ cp -R <ofidps github directory>/shSwithes /home/mininet
	
	or just
	
	$ cp -R <ofidps github directory>/sh* /home/mininet
      
      1.3 Copy the script with the custom tests written using Python Mininet API:

	$ cp <ofidps github directory>/mininet/custom/cenarioTesteLAN-WAN.py /home/mininet/mininet/custom
	
      1.4 Depending from your installation method you will have to install on mininet machine some softwares 
      to execute the custom Of-IDPS tests, like:
	- Tcpdump - http://www.tcpdump.org/
	- Apache - http://www.apache.org/
	- Iperf - https://iperf.fr/
	- Snort IDS - https://www.snort.org/
	- Hyenae - http://sourceforge.net/projects/hyenae/
	- Nmap - http://nmap.org/
	- NTP client on mininet and NTP server on Of-IDPS controller - http://www.ntp.org/ 
	- SSHFS - http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html
        

  Finally, when all is working, you can execute the steps from executionStepsForAutomaticTestsWithOf-IDPS.pdf tutorial to execute Of-IDPS custom tests.
