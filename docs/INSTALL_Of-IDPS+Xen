* Of-IDPS instalation:

  Read the INSTALL_Of-IDPS file to install Of-IDPS.
  
  Attention, if you want to use the Snort NIDS as a sensor in the Of-IDPS is recommended to install the sshfs on the Of-IDPS host, to share the security alerts generated from Snort IDS to Of-IDPS controller.

      
* To execute Of-IDPS in a virtual Xen environment:

  1. Install the Xen Server (http://xenserver.org/) with vSwitch (http://openvswitch.org/).
  
  2. Copy xenScripts directory from this github project to Xen server, for example:
    $ cp -R <ofidps github directory>/xenScripts ~
  
  3. Then start the Of-IDPS script:
    $ sh ~/xenScripts/ofidps start
  
  
+ Attention, unfortunately each time that you stop and start one VM you must rerun the ofidps script (step 3).

+ Attention! The ofidps script presumed that the Snort IDS is a VM in the Xen server. 
  The Snort VM must be set with the IDSOfIDSP name, yet this VM must have two network interfaces: 
    eth0 - used to access the network, can be used for example to manage the IDS;
    eth1 - that is the mirror port used to collect all network traffic. 

  IF YOU, WON'T USE THIS CONFIGURATIONS YOU MUST MANUALLY CONFIGURE THE XEN SCRIPTS.

+ The scripts also presumed that Xen server have two real network interfaces eth0 (xenbr0) and eth1 (xenbr1). 
  In the script, we use xenbr0 to VMs (common network) and xenbr1 to connect the vSwitch in the Xen server to the 
  Of-IDPS controller (OpenFlow network).
  
+ In the Xen network environment is necessary add the IP address of some network elements to avoid problems like false positives. The recommended IP are:
  - Of-IDPS controller;
  - Xen Domain 0;
  - IDS;
  For now, you can make it directly in the source code, on the class LearningSwitchTutorialSoution.java in allowIPs method, example:

    // IP of OpenFlow controller
    //private static int controllerOfIP = IPv4.toIPv4Address("192.168.2.111");
    private static Set<Integer> allowIPs = new HashSet<Integer>();
    static {
        allowIPs.add(IPv4.toIPv4Address("192.168.2.111")); 	// OpenFlow controller;
    	allowIPs.add(IPv4.toIPv4Address("192.168.2.112")); 	// Xen Controller - on eth1;
    	allowIPs.add(IPv4.toIPv4Address("172.16.2.130")); 	// Xen Controller - on eth0;
    	allowIPs.add(IPv4.toIPv4Address("192.168.2.133")); 	// IDS;
    }

+  Finally, when all is working, you can execute the steps from executionStepsForAutomaticTestsWithOf-IDPS.pdf tutorial to execute Of-IDPS custom tests.
