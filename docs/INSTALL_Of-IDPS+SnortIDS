* Of-IDPS instalation:

  Read the INSTALL_Of-IDPS file to install Of-IDPS.

  
* Install Snort IDS (https://www.snort.org/) to monitor your local network (It is optional, but recommended): 
  
  The Of-IDPS uses IDS as sensors, for now, just Snort is supported. Remember that the Snort NIDS need receive all network 
  traffic to correctly analyse threats, then you probably will need mirror all switches traffic to the Snort host or put 
  it in a strategic local.
  
  1. Install and configure IDS Snort (https://www.snort.org/) to monitor the network;
  
  2. Install and configure Barnyard (https://github.com/firnsy/barnyard2) to get the snort alerts and save in the postgres 
    database (we recommend that the Snort database stay on the Of-IDPS machine).
    

+ It is recomented see the executionStepsForAutomaticTestsWithOf-IDPS.pdf tutorial.


The other way (old - non database):

1. Share the Snort alerts with the Of-IDPS controller:

    1.1. Install a SSH server on the IDS (http://www.openssh.com/).
    
    1.2. Install the sshfs on the Of-IDPS controller host (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html) 
    
    1.3. On the Of-IDPS controller host execute the command:
    
      1.3.1. At first time, create the directory to mount the alerts:
      
	$ mkdir -p /mnt/armazem/openflow/tmp/alertas
	
      1.3.2. Use the sshfs command to mount the snort alerts:
      
	$ sshfs mininet@192.168.1.200:/home/mininet/alertas /mnt/armazem/openflow/tmp/alertas
