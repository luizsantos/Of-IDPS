* Of-IDPS instalation:

  We have two ways to install and execute Of-IDPS: (i) using a Of-IDPS virtual machine - VM; or (ii) installing source code in your system:

  i. The easy way, download the Of-IDPS VM:

    1. Make Of-IDPS VM download on the URL:
     
      - https://mega.co.nz/#!csZFGKTZ!TZBCROjFBFPJi6D0P0Y6K4VQoDsKKDUeL84i9QU81Uw
    
    2. Execute this VM. The user named "of" will enter automaticaly on the grafic interface, if necessary all passwords are "ofidps" including the "root" password. 
    The postgres user in the postgres database on the VM also is "ofidps".

    
  ii. To install Of-IDPS in your own system:

    1. Install Beacon OpenFlow controller using the following tutorial: https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/Beacon/Quick+Start

    2. Inside of Beacon directory, make:

      2.1. Remove the net.beaconcontroller.tutorial directory, for example:

	$ rm -rf <of-idps home directory>/net.beaconcontroller.tutorial

      2.2. Clone this github project:

	$ cd <of-idps home directory>
	
	$ git clone https://github.com/luizsantos/Of-IDPS
  
      2.3. Create a link from Of-IDPS home directory to net.beaconcontroller.tutorial directory:
	
	$ ln -s <of-idps home directory>/Of-IDPS <of-idps home directory>/net.beaconcontroller.tutorial
	
      2.4. Install and configure postgres database:
      
	2.4.1. Install Postgres database (http://www.postgresql.org/);
	
	2.4.2. Create database:
	  $ sh <of-idps home directory>/net.beaconcontroller.tutorial/scripts/DatabaseScripts/createDB_POSTGRES.sh
	  $ sh <of-idps home directory>/net.beaconcontroller.tutorial/scripts/DatabaseScripts/createTables_POSTGRES.sh

      2.5. Execute the Of-IDPS with the name of net.beaconcontroller.tutorial in the Eclipse project. 
      For help, you can read the https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/Beacon/Quick+Start 
      or follow the steps on the executionStepsForAutomaticTestsWithOf-IDPS.pdf tutorial. 
      More configurations can be necessary in accordance with your network environment.

      2.6. Set up your OpenFlow switches to use the Of-IDPS OpenFlow controller IP address.


+ Attention, if you want to use the Snort NIDS as a sensor in the Of-IDPS is recommended to install the sshfs on the Of-IDPS host, to share the security alerts generated from Snort IDS to Of-IDPS controller.    

+ It is recomended see the executionStepsForAutomaticTestsWithOf-IDPS.pdf tutorial.
