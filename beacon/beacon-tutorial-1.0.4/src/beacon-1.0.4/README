RUNNING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have downloaded a "binary" build, there should be a beacon executable
in the root folder of the downloaded archive.  Running this will start Beacon
and put you into the OSGi console.  For example on Linux:

    ./beacon

To quit Beacon after starting, type exit and press enter.

Two configurations are included in binary builds, the default (in the
configuration directory), includes layer 2 shortest path routing, and the web
user interface.  An alternative configuration (configurationSwitch), starts
only the learning switch application, and is useful for basic testing
functionality and benchmarking.  You can select a configuration with the
configuration argument:

    ./beacon -configuration configurationSwitch

Additionally, Beacon has a number of startup options contained both within
the beacon.properties file and beacon.ini.  Please see the website for a
description of all options.


DEVELOPING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The easiest way to get familiar with Beacon is to run through the tutorials
available on the website.  There is a tutorial bundle available that includes
source for Beacon and OpenFlowJ, as well as the Eclipse code editor.  Please
see the website for the list of current tutorials and guides available.  There
is also a user forum available for getting help.
