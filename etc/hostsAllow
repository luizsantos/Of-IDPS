# This config file has a list of IPs address (not names) 
# that will not be submitted to the Of-IDPS security rules.
# 
# Here, you can put IP addresses, for instance, of the 
# OpenFlow controller and some hosts that can't be blocked 
# by the Of-IDPS. 
#
# You must put one IP by line, and the IP must be the first
# thing on the line, after you must give a blank space, and
# then you can put anything, like a comment (everything 
# after the space will be ignored).
# e.g.
#127.0.0.1 this is a loopback address
#
# Attention don't put a blank space on the line start or 
# any other thing, the first thing is the IP address.
