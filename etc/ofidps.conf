# This file is used to configure the Of-IDPS.
#
# But pay ATTENTION be careful with blank spaces into this file!
# The attributes must follow the format:  
# attribute=value
# Without spaces, on the begin, middle and in the end. 
# Otherwise the Of-IDPS software will not start and a error like:
# 	"Error creating bean with name 'tutorial' defined in URL [bundleentry://7.fwk682317035/META-INF/spring/context.xml]"

# * Of-IDPS disable/enable methods
#
# Attributes to disable...
# in the attributes to disable use 1 to disable or any other value to enable, like 0 (zero).

# - Use to enable or disable ALL Of-IDPS architecture.
DISABLE_OFIDPS=0

# - Get OpenFlow statistics
#
# This can disable the ability of Of-IDPF collect Openflows statistics 
# messages from network elements, like switches.
# If this is is equal to 1 (enable), this will too affect disable the
# disableOfIDPS_UseOfAlerts because we won't have OpenFlow data to do
# the analysis. 
DISABLE_OFIDPS_GET_OPENFLOW_STATISTICS_FROM_NETWORK=0

# - Analyse and generate security alerts using OpenFlow messages/statistics.
#
# Enable or disable the analysis of security threats based on OpenFlow
# statistics, this depend that the
# disableOfIDPS_UseOfgetStatisticsFromNetwork variable is enabled
# (different of 1).
# If just this variable is disabled and the
# disableOfIDPS_UseOfgetStatisticsFromNetwork variable is enable, then, the
# Of-IDPS will just collect Openflow statistics messages but won't use this
# for reactions.
DISABLE_OFIDPS_ANALYSE_SECURITY_USING_OPENFLOW_STATISTICS=0

# Enable or disable the use of external IDS message on the Of-IDPS.

# Disable sensorial memory

# Disable short-term memory
DISABLE_MEMORY_SHORT=0

# Disable long-term bad memory.
DISABLE_MEMORY_LONG_BAD=0

# Disable long-term good memory.
DISABLE_MEMORY_LONG_GOOD=0

# Disable different forms of security containment for different levels of security alerts.
#      In the Of-IDPS, packets related with: 
#       - Low security level alert, will has your bandwidth softly reduced;
#       - Medium security level alert, will has your bandwidth severely reduced;
#       - High security level alert, will has your packets blocked.
#      
#  ATTENTION - If we disable this control ALL PACKETS related with alerts will be BLOCKED.
DISABLE_DIFFERENT_SECURITY_CONTAINMENT_FOR_DIFFERENT_ALERTS_LEVELS=0

# Attribute that deals with the order of the rules to be analyzed and applied in the Of-IDPS.
#    Order to be read/analyzed the memories rules:
#
#           1       |     2     |     3     |   4
#      -------------|-----------|-----------|----------

#      short        | short     |longGood   | longBad
#      longBad      | longBad   |longBad    |
#
# You must use the previous numbers to define the order of memories.

# Method to recover remembrances to long memory.
# You must choose:
# 1 - Get all remembrances - this can consume a lot of the machine process.
# 2 - Get remembrances using a limit to recovery the database register, example get the last 10.000 registers.
# 3 - Get remembrances using a limit but get the registers randomly.
# 4 - Get remembrances using a limit but get the registers randomly and using a statistic threshold based on the amount of existent registers in database to generate reliable samples.
# 5 - Get remembrances up to seconds ago.
# 6 - Get remembrances up to seconds ago but get the registers randomly.
# 7 - Get remembrances up to seconds ago but get the registers randomly and using a statistic threshold based on the amount of existent registers in database to generate reliable samples.
